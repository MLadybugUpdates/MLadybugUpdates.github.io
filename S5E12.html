        <p style="color: rebeccapurple; font-size: 35px;font-family: monospace;">What would Marinette do without her friends? The whole gang has decided to do everything to help her finally get closer to Adrien. This time, anything goes. But Marinette knows how to be surprising, again and again! Especially when no one’s told her anything, and no one knows that she also has come up with a unique plan to try and tell Adrien how she feels. They’re all in to find out that it’s better to tell things clearly to your friends if you don’t want to cause a misunderstanding... that could lead to someone being akumatized!</p>
